# System Documentation

Documentation for each major system/subsystem in the project.

## Creating System Documentation

1. Use `/understand [system]` command in Claude Code
2. This ensures research is done before design work begins

## Structure

Each system folder should contain:
- `overview.md` - System purpose, interfaces, requirements
- `design.md` - Design decisions and rationale
- `analysis.md` - Engineering analysis and calculations summary

## Naming

Create a folder for each system: `system-name/`

Example: `fuel-system/`, `control-system/`, `enclosure/`
