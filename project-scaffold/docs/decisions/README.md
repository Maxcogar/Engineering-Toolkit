# Decision Records

Engineering decisions documented for future reference.

## Creating a Decision Record

1. Use the `/decision` slash command in Claude Code
2. Or copy `000-template.md` and fill in sections

## Format

Decision records follow this structure:
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Options**: What alternatives were considered
- **Decision**: What was chosen and why
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications

## Naming

`DEC-NNN-brief-description.md`

Example: `DEC-001-material-selection.md`
