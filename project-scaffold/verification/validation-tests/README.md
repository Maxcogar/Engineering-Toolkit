# Validation Tests

Physical testing to validate analysis predictions.

## Purpose

Confirm that analytical/computational predictions match real-world behavior.

## Process

1. Identify prediction to validate
2. Design test to measure predicted quantity
3. Execute test, collect data
4. Compare measured vs predicted
5. Document correlation

## Documentation

Include:
- What was predicted (with uncertainty)
- Test setup and procedure
- Measured results (with uncertainty)
- Correlation analysis
- Conclusions and any model updates needed
