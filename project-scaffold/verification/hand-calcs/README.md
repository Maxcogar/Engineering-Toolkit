# Hand Calculations

Manual verification of computational results.

## Purpose

Independent check using simplified methods to verify computational analysis is in the right ballpark.

## Process

1. Identify key result to verify
2. Use simplified hand calculation
3. Compare to computational result
4. Document any discrepancies

## Acceptable Variance

- Order of magnitude: Always match
- Within 20%: Typically acceptable
- Exact match: Not expected (different methods)
