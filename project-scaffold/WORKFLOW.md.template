## Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth:** All design parameters live in `project_params.py`
2. **Executable Calculations:** Use Jupyter notebooks, not static markdown
3. **Traceable Decisions:** Document all design choices in `docs/decisions/`
4. **Verification Required:** All calculations must be checked against literature/benchmarks
5. **Results, Not Raw Data:** External tools (CFD, FEA) contribute summary findings only

## Daily Workflow

### Running Calculations

1. Open relevant calculation notebook in `calculations/[system]/`
2. Notebook automatically imports parameters from `project_params.py`
3. Run calculations, adjust as needed
4. Generate output specifications
5. If verified and approved, update system specifications

### Making Design Decisions

1. Perform analysis (calculations, trade studies, etc.)
2. Create decision record in `docs/decisions/DEC-XXX-title.md`
3. Document: what was decided, alternatives considered, rationale, assumptions
4. Link to supporting calculations
5. Commit decision record to Git

### Adding New Calculations

1. Copy template from `templates/calculation-notebook-template.ipynb`
2. Place in appropriate `calculations/[system]/` folder
3. Rename with descriptive name
4. Follow template structure: Purpose > Inputs > Theory > Calculations > Verification > Conclusions
5. Always import from `project_params.py`:

   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.append('../..')
   from project_params import *
   ```

6. Always cite sources for equations
7. Include verification against known results

### Creating Test Documentation

When performing tests:

1. Create test directory structure:

   ```text
   testing/data/TEST-NNN/
   testing/results/TEST-NNN/
   ```

2. Use template: `templates/test-results-template.md`
3. Save raw data to `testing/data/TEST-NNN/` (never modify)
4. Document procedure, observations, and results
5. Create analysis notebook in `testing/analysis/`

### Documenting Design Iterations

When creating or updating CAD models:

1. Work in `design/` root directory
2. When reaching milestone, create iteration snapshot:
   - Copy files to `design/iterations/vX.X/`
   - Use template: `templates/design-iteration-template.md`
   - Document what changed and why
3. Create manufacturing drawings in `design/drawings/`

### Parameter Changes

When a design parameter changes:

1. Update `project_params.py`
2. Re-run affected calculation notebooks
3. Review outputs for any issues
4. Update affected specifications
5. Document the change and rationale in decision record

## Verification Process

All calculations supporting actual hardware MUST be verified before use.

### What Needs Verification

- Dimensions used for manufacturing
- Safety-critical calculations (stress, pressure, temperature)
- Performance predictions
- Anything influencing design decisions

### Verification Workflow

1. Complete calculation notebook (marked "Draft")
2. Create verification report using `templates/verification-report-template.md`
3. Independent review using different method or cross-reference with literature
4. Compare results:
   - Exact match not required
   - Within 5-10% typically acceptable
   - Large differences require investigation
5. Document findings in verification report
6. Update original notebook status to "Verified"

## Git Workflow

**Commit frequency:**
- Calculation development: commit when working, can be messy
- Decision records: always commit immediately
- Approved specs: clean commits with clear messages
- Templates/infrastructure: commit when stable

**Commit message format:**
```
[TYPE] Brief description

Types: CALC, DECISION, SPEC, DOC, INFRA, TEST, DESIGN, FIX
```

## Claude's Role

Claude can:
- Create and run calculation notebooks
- Search literature for verification data
- Generate decision record documents
- Check calculations against templates
- Suggest when verification is needed
- Help organize and document work

Claude should NOT:
- Make design decisions without your approval
- Declare work "complete" or "ready"
- Skip verification steps
- Generate specifications without calculations backing them

## Available Templates

All templates are in `templates/` directory:

- `calculation-notebook-template.ipynb` - Engineering calculations
- `test-results-template.md` - Test documentation
- `design-iteration-template.md` - Design change documentation
- `manufacturing-process-template.md` - Manufacturing procedures
- `research-notes-template.md` - Research documentation
- `verification-report-template.md` - Calculation verification
- Decision template: `docs/decisions/000-template.md`
