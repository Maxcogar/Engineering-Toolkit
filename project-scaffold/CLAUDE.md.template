# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this project.

## Session Workflow

**At session start:** Read `CONTEXT.md` to understand current project state, blocking issues, and next actions.

**At session end:** Update `CONTEXT.md` with:
- What was worked on and accomplished
- Any decisions made (create decision records in `docs/decisions/` for significant choices)
- What to pick up next session
- Any knowledge documented in `docs/reference/`

## Project Architecture

This is an engineering R&D workspace with the following structure:

- **docs/decisions/** - Numbered decision records (DEC-NNN format). Document why engineering choices were made.
- **docs/reference/** - Claude's learned knowledge. Create files here when researching topics for this project.
- **docs/research/_sources.md** - User's research sources and URLs.
- **calculations/** - Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for engineering calculations.
- **design/** - CAD files, drawings, and design iteration snapshots in `iterations/vX.X/`.
- **testing/** - Test data (raw), analysis scripts, and results kept separate.
- **manufacturing/** - Process docs, toolpaths, and BOM.

## Git Conventions
