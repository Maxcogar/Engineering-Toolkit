## Purpose

This document captures understanding of the [system name] before ANY design or calculation work. It ensures we understand constraints, geometry, and operating principles from reference material.

## System Overview

### What This System Is
[Brief description: what is this system, what does it do, where does it fit in the overall engine?]

### System Type/Architecture
[e.g., "Can-type annular combustor" or "Radial compressor with inducer" - the fundamental architecture]

### Operating Principles
[How does this system work? What are the physical principles?]

## Reference Documents Read

### Primary References
1. [Document name/path] - [What you learned from it]
2. [Document name/path] - [What you learned from it]

### Secondary References
1. [Additional sources consulted]
2. [Academic papers, web articles, etc.]

**NOTE**: You must READ these documents, not just list them. Summarize key findings from each.

## Key Constraints

### Geometric Constraints
- [Physical dimensions, clearances, envelope constraints]
- [e.g., "Flametube must fit within 80mm diameter can"]
- [e.g., "Radial air injection holes every 30° around circumference"]

### Thermal Constraints
- [Operating temperatures]
- [Material temperature limits]
- [Heat transfer considerations]

### Mechanical Constraints
- [Pressure differentials]
- [Stress limits]
- [Vibration concerns]

### Manufacturing Constraints
- [What can/cannot be manufactured]
- [Available processes and tools]
- [Material availability]

### Performance Constraints
- [Required performance metrics]
- [Efficiency targets]
- [Operating range]

## Geometry and Physical Layout

[Detailed description of the physical geometry, structure, and layout]

### Key Dimensions
- [Critical dimensions with sources]

### Material Flow Paths
- [How air/fuel/exhaust flows through the system]

### Interfaces
- [How this system connects to other systems]

## Incompatible Approaches

### What WILL NOT Work
1. **[Approach Name]**: [Why it's incompatible]
   - Reason: [Explain based on constraints above]
   - Example: "Trapped Vortex Combustor design requires cavity in wall, but JATO uses radial air injection through wall - PHYSICALLY INCOMPATIBLE"

2. **[Another Approach]**: [Why it won't work]

## Compatible Approaches

### What WILL Work
1. **[Approach Name]**: [Why it's compatible with constraints]
   - Advantages: ...
   - Challenges: ...
   - Reference: [Where this approach is documented]

## Design Approach Selection

Based on the constraints and compatible approaches above:

**Recommended Approach**: [Which approach to pursue]

**Rationale**: [Why this approach, referencing constraints and references]

**Key Design Parameters**: [What parameters need to be calculated/determined]
